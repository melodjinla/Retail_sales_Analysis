Retail Sales Analysis
This project explores transaction data from a UK-based online retailer. The dataset spans 2010 and 2011 and highlights key trends in revenue, product sales, and customer locations.

Highlights
Analyzed approximately 500,000 transactions over two years.

Found that PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE was the top-selling product by volume, with over 80,000 units sold.

Revenue peaked in November 2011 at more than £1.16 million, suggesting strong seasonal demand.

Identified the United Kingdom as the primary customer base, with over 3,900 unique customers, far ahead of Germany, France, and Spain.

Tools Used
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn): for cleaning, aggregating, and visualizing the data.

SQLite + SQL: for summary statistics and quick ad-hoc queries (database file stored locally due to size).

Jupyter Notebook: to document and execute the full analysis.

Power BI: to build an interactive dashboard summarizing the key insights.

Recommendations
Consider stocking more high-volume items like PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE and similar popular products.

Investigate the marketing campaigns or seasonal factors that drove the November 2011 spike to see if that success can be repeated.

Explore customer loyalty initiatives targeted at the UK market, which makes up the vast majority of the customer base.
